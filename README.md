# realtime-ga4-page-tracker
Real-time page-specific analytics for Google Analytics 4 using Docker, Apache Airflow, and Metabase. Track individual page performance, conversions, and visitor metrics in real-time - something GA4's standard UI can't easily provide.

You need to run the command below from the main folder of this repo to make the main scripts executable.
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```
